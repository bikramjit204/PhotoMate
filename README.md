Image Processing is one of the most basic and important step for any vision based applications. In this project a basic image processing viewer is developed using MATLAB Guide. The software is capable of performing basic functions of Image Processing on an image and let’s the user analyze the effect of the algorithms in the image with the help of a visual output as well as histogram. It’s a basic tool to study the different effects on an image and a much needed tool for educational purposes.
